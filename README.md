# Hello-word
My project my opinion
My life is but a dream. It is difficult to connect poetry and new inforation or technology. Every changes are difficult.
The time is over. The new time is for education. Nobody should stay in the past. 
Now we can learn and go ahead. This is good time to have highest knowledge. The time of education and technology 
determine many people to rat racing. We should hear our heart and go with new time to be a programmist.
Now we can studying technology by internet, becoues there are a lot of coureses for peoples whsoe are  interested in education and
hihher steps on level of intelligence. 
As I know we cen be respected for a money or knowledeg. Sometimes we are respected becoues we can feel by our heart and for our
love for another people. This depend on a side of seeing.
